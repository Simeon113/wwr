                <h2>How the process works</h2>
                <p>When you create your order, please send us any information you have about what you want your print to look like, using words and/or images. Select the estimated size you think your print is going to be. Pricing will be finalized when the model's design is completed. Within one to two days you should receive an email from us to start working towards your model's final design. We will send you images of your print created within our 3D design software and will not charge you until you are completely happy with how it looks. You may pay to have the print painted, which we will do as close as we can to whatever information you give us. Once the print is completed, we will send you a final email with what the completed print looks like and what the final price came out to.</p>
                <h2>When can you expect to receive your order?</h2>
                <p>Shipping times will vary by region. The design process can take anywhere from 1-7 days depending on the complexity of the design, the information given to us, and any changes made along the way. We will work to assure that we created the highest quality print we can in the shortest amount of time possible. We will package your print using the utmost care and protection we can to assure that it arrives in perfect condition.</p>
