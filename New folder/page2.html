                <h2>What can 3D printing be used for?</h2>
                <p>3D printing can be used to create any kind of shape made out of whatever material has been put into the printer (mostly plastics). 3D printers can be used both to make objects with a practical purpose or just for display. Simply need a specifically shaped object to replace a broken part? 3D printing can solve that. Have an idea for an amazing looking model that you want to put on your shelf? 3D printing can make that happen. If you want an object with moving parts, multiple pieces can be printed out and then fit together. Objects will come out with whatever color the material was that was used to print them, but can be painted afterwards.</p>
                <h2>What are we able to print?</h2>
                <p>Our printers have the ability to print objects with dimensions of up to 30cm. We can print objects in multiple parts that can then be fit together, however you are charged based on the amount of printing material you use. All of our prints are created using plastic filaments. We assure you that your finished print will be high-quality and durable.</p>
