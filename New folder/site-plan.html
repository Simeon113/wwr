      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever had a design, model, or idea that you wanted to see created into a physical, 3D object, but lacked the resources or knowledge of how to turn it from an image inside your mind into a reality? Our team can take written descriptions, diagrams, measurements, or simple pictures and turn them into a durable, high-quality 3D printed object and send it straight to your home for an affordable price. Whether it's for display, practical application, or just for fun, we promise that you will be completely satisfied with the end results!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our audience for this site is people who either don’t have access to a 3D printer or who don’t know much about 3D modeling who have something they would like to be printed out. We want our site to be used by people who want to print stuff for a variety of different purposes, as long as it can be realistically done with the size and material the printer allows for. They can be people who give very detailed specifications or just a general idea.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        <h4>Why use our site?</h4>
        <p> 3D printers cost anywhere from a couple hundred to thousands of dollars. To some, it’s simply not worth it to invest not only money both for the printer and material, but also time into learning how to use 3D modeling software effectively enough to get the design they want. We at [Insert website name] not only provide a cheap, easy, quick option for how to bring your ideas out of your head and into reality, but will also assist in the design process to assure that you get the best possible version of your project.</p> 
        <h4>How to get started</h4>
        <p>It all starts with an idea. You are only limited by your imagination. Once you have that idea, you have the option to be as specific or vague about the specifications of your model as you want. Do you have the exact dimensions, design, and color down to the smallest detail figured out? Send us that information, and we will do our best to match it as close as we can. Have only a rough sketch of the kind of object you are looking for? Then we will work with you to design a finished model that you are happy with. Simply attach any information and images that you want to include in your order form.</p>

        <h4>What can 3D printing be used for?</h4>
        <p>3D printing can be used to create any kind of shape made out of whatever material  has been put into the printer (mostly plastics). 3D printers can be used both to make objects with a practical purpose or just for display. Simply need a specifically shaped object to replace a broken part? 3D printing can solve that. Have an idea for an amazing looking model that you want to put on your shelf? 3D printing can make that happen. If you want an object with moving parts, multiple pieces can be printed out and then fit together. Objects will come out with whatever color the material was that was used to print them, but can be painted afterwards.</p> 
        <h4>What are we able to print?</h4>
        <p>Our printers have the ability to print objects with dimensions of up to 30cm. We can print objects in multiple parts that can then be fit together, however you are charged based on the amount of printing material you use. All of our prints are created using plastic filaments. We assure you that your finished print will be high-quality and durable.</p>

        <h4>How the process works</h4>
        <p>When you create your order, please send us any information you have about what you want your print to look like, using words and/or images. Select the estimated size you think your print is going to be. Pricing will be finalized when the model's design is completed. Within one to two days you should receive an email from us to start working towards your model's final design.  We will send you images of your print created within our 3D design software and will not charge you until you are completely happy with how it looks. You may pay to have the print painted, which we will do as close as we can to whatever information you give  us. Once the print is completed, we will send you a final email with what the completed print looks like and what the final price came out to.</p>
        <h4>When can you expect to receive your order?</h4>
        <p> Shipping times will vary by region. The design process can take anywhere from 1-7 days depending on the complexity of the design, the information given to us, and any changes made along the way. We will work to assure that we created the highest quality print we can in the shortest amount of time possible. We will package your print using the utmost care and protection we can to assure that it arrives in perfect condition. </p>
