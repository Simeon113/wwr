                <h1>Why use our site?</h1>
                <p>3D printers cost anywhere from a couple hundred to thousands of dollars. To some, itâ€™s simply not worth it to invest not only money both for the printer and material, but also time into learning how to use 3D modeling software effectively enough to get the design they want. We at [Insert website name] not only provide a cheap, easy, quick option for how to bring your ideas out of your head and into reality, but will also assist in the design process to assure that you get the best possible version of your project.</p>

                <p>It all starts with an idea. You are only limited by your imagination. Once you have that idea, you have the option to be as specific or vague about the specifications of your model as you want. Do you have the exact dimensions, design, and color down to the smallest detail figured out? Send us that information, and we will do our best to match it as close as we can. Have only a rough sketch of the kind of object you are looking for? Then we will work with you to design a finished model that you are happy with. Simply attach any information and images that you want to include in your order form.</p>
